    "# What Are Functions in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are one of the core building blocks in Python, allowing you to organize your code into reusable, modular pieces. A **function** is a block of code designed to perform a specific task, and it can be executed when called.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use Functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reusability**: Write once, use multiple times. Avoid repetition by encapsulating logic into functions.\n",
    "- **Readability**: Break down complex code into smaller, manageable chunks.\n",
    "- **Maintainability**: Easier to debug and modify your code by isolating specific functionality.\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Functions allow you to build scalable programs that can grow in complexity without becoming unmanageable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Anatomy of a Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the structure of a function in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def function_name(parameters):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    Optional: A docstring to describe what the function does.\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    # Code block\n",
    "    return result\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components:\n",
    "1. **`def`**: The keyword used to define a function.\n",
    "2. **`function_name`**: The name of the function, which should describe its purpose.\n",
    "3. **`parameters`**: Optional inputs to the function (enclosed in parentheses). These allow you to pass data into the function.\n",
    "4. **Docstring**: An optional string describing the function's purpose and behavior.\n",
    "5. **Code block**: The body of the function containing the operations it performs.\n",
    "6. **`return`**: An optional statement used to send the function’s output back to the caller.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: A Simple Function\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet(name):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    Greets a person by their name.\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling the function\n",
    "message = greet(\"Arman\")\n",
    "print(message)  # Output: Hello, Arman!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Built-in Functions**: Predefined functions in Python, like `len()`, `print()`, and `sum()`.\n",
    "2. **User-defined Functions**: Functions that you create to solve specific problems.\n",
    "3. **Lambda Functions**: Anonymous, one-line functions used for short operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions make your code:\n",
    "- **Efficient**: By avoiding code repetition.\n",
    "- **Structured**: By dividing functionality into smaller parts.\n",
    "- **Dynamic**: By accepting parameters and returning results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start incorporating functions into your Python scripts to make them more robust and easier to maintain!\n"

    "# Example 1: Write a Function to Calculate the GC Content of a DNA Sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will write a Python function that calculates the **GC content** of a DNA sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Is GC Content?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **GC content** of a DNA sequence is the percentage of nucleotides in the sequence that are either **G** (guanine) or **C** (cytosine). This is an important measure in genetics and bioinformatics, as GC content can influence the stability and function of DNA.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ GC \\text{ Content (\\%) } = \\frac{\\text{Count of G + Count of C}}{\\text{Total Length of Sequence}} \\times 100 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "Given the DNA sequence:  \n",
    "`ATGCGCGT`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Count of `G`: 3  \n",
    "2. Count of `C`: 3  \n",
    "3. Total length: 8  \n",
    "\n",
    "GC Content = \\((3 + 3) / 8 \times 100 = 75\\%\\)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Is GC Content Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **DNA Stability**: GC pairs are connected by three hydrogen bonds, whereas AT pairs have only two. A higher GC content generally leads to greater thermal stability of the DNA molecule.\n",
    "2. **Gene Expression**: Regions with high GC content, like CpG islands, are often associated with gene promoters and regulation of gene expression.\n",
    "3. **Taxonomy and Evolution**: GC content varies between organisms and can be used as a distinguishing feature in evolutionary studies and species classification.\n",
    "4. **Sequencing and PCR**: Knowledge of GC content is critical for designing primers and optimizing PCR protocols, as it affects the annealing temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a function named `gc_content` that:\n",
    "   - Accepts a DNA sequence as input.\n",
    "   - Returns the GC content as a percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Read the DNA sequence from a **FASTA file** named `Ecoli_genome.fasta`. Assume the file contains a valid DNA sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Implement:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Parse the FASTA File**:\n",
    "   Use Python to open and read the `Ecoli_genome.fasta` file. Skip the header line (starting with `>`), and extract the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Write the Function**:\n",
    "   Define the `gc_content` function to compute the GC content of the sequence.\n",

    "In this exercise, you will write a Python function that takes a DNA sequence as input and returns its **reverse complement**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Is the Reverse Complement?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **reverse complement** of a DNA sequence is formed by two steps:\n",
    "1. **Complement**: Replace each nucleotide with its complement:\n",
    "    - `A` (adenine) → `T` (thymine)\n",

    "# Functions vs. Methods in Python\n",

    "Functions and methods are both used to perform specific tasks in Python, but they differ in their context and how they are called.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Are Classes and Instances?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a **class** is a blueprint for creating objects. Objects are instances of classes, and they encapsulate data (attributes) and behaviors (methods). Classes are important because they help organize and structure your code around real-world entities.\n",
