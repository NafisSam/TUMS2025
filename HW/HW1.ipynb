    "# Homework: Python Basics and Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "This homework will test your understanding of Python variables, basic operations, and string manipulations. Each problem is designed to challenge you and encourage exploration of Python's capabilities.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Problem 1: String Manipulations and Formatting\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a Python program that takes a user's first and last name as input and does the following:\n",
    "1. Converts the first name to all uppercase letters.\n",
    "2. Converts the last name to all lowercase letters.\n",
    "3. Combines the first and last name into a single string with the format: `\"Last Name, First Name\"`.\n",
    "4. Prints the formatted string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Input:\n",
    "First Name: John\n",
    "Last Name: DOE\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "doe, JOHN\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem 2: Arithmetic Operations and Input\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program that:\n",
    "1. Asks the user for two numbers (you can assume valid inputs).\n",
    "2. Computes and prints:\n",
    "   - The sum of the numbers.\n",
    "   - The product of the numbers.\n",
    "   - The division result (as a float) of the first number divided by the second.\n",
    "3. Format the results to show up to 2 decimal places.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Input:\n",
    "Enter first number: 10\n",
    "Enter second number: 3\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "Sum: 13\n",
    "Product: 30\n",
    "Division: 3.33\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Problem 3: Counting and String Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program that:\n",
    "1. Takes a string input from the user.\n",
    "2. Counts and prints the number of vowels in the string.\n",
    "3. Converts the string to uppercase and prints the result.\n",
    "4. Replaces all spaces in the string with a dash (`-`) and prints the modified string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Input:\n",
    "Hello World\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "Vowel Count: 3\n",
    "Uppercase: HELLO WORLD\n",
    "Modified String: HELLO-WORLD\n",

    "## Problem 4: Palindrome Checker\n",
    "\n",
    "A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward. Write a program that:\n",
    "1. Asks the user for a string.\n",
    "2. Checks if the string is a palindrome (case-insensitive).\n",
    "3. Prints `\"Palindrome\"` if true, otherwise `\"Not a palindrome\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Input:\n",
    "Racecar\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "Palindrome\n",

    "## Problem 5: Advanced String Formatting\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program that:\n",
    "1. Prompts the user to enter a sentence.\n",
    "2. Formats the sentence to:\n",
    "   - Capitalize the first letter of every word.\n",
    "   - Center-align the sentence within a width of 50 characters, filling the space with `*`.\n",
    "3. Prints the formatted sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Input:\n",
    "python is awesome\n",

    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "- Use Python's built-in string methods like `.upper()`, `.lower()`, `.format()`, `.replace()`, and `.capitalize()`.\n",
    "- Look up any unfamiliar functions using Python documentation or online resources.\n",
    "- Save your programs in separate files (e.g., `problem1.py`, `problem2.py`, etc.) and test them thoroughly.\n",
